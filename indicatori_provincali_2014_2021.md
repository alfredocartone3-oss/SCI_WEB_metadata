# Dataset Metadata – Provincial Well-being Indicators (NUTS3)

## Description
This dataset contains provincial-level composite indicators of well-being for Italian NUTS3 regions over the period **2014–2021**.  
The indicators are derived using different dimensionality-reduction and spatial analysis techniques in order to capture both structural and spatial components of territorial well-being.

## Spatial coverage

# Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **NUTS_ID** | String | Unique identifier of the NUTS3 territorial unit according to the European NUTS classification. |
| **Provinces** | String | Name of the Italian province|
| **Year** | Integer | Reference year of the observation (2014–2021). |
| **indice_originale** | Numeric | number of the record |
| **MPI_base** | Numeric | Composite indicator calculated using the non-compensatory aggregation method (Mazziotta–Pareto Index) applied to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores of the eleven domains considered. |
| **MPI_gwpca** | Numeric | Composite indicator calculated using the non-compensatory aggregation method (Mazziotta–Pareto Index) applied to Geographically Weighted PCA (GWPCA) scores of the eleven domains considered. |
| **MPI_spatial** | Numeric | Composite indicator calculated using the non-compensatory aggregation method (Mazziotta–Pareto Index) applied to the spatial component scores capturing the spatially structured part of well-being of the eleven domains. |
| **MPI_filt** | Numeric | Composite indicator calculated using the non-compensatory aggregation method (Mazziotta–Pareto Index) applied to the filtered scores capturing the non-spatial component of well-being of the eleven domains. |
